My navigation interface will have a spinning globe that will stop when the user hovers over the image. I plan on using either css transformations or webGL to create the graphic. I will have three locations that the user can select from Japan, India, Brazil. When the user clicks on a country, it will take them to a white webpage that will have music of the given country playing. Graphics, representing the socio-cultural identity of the nation will then start filling the white page (option to use either css animations or javascript). Once the entire page is filled, a map of japan will superimpose the collage. The user will have the option to click the image, and the background will change. In order to return to the main navigation page, the user will have to click the United Nations symbol at the bottom of the page. The intent of my drawing is to foster a sense of cultural identity, while additionally creating a sense of unity through the stylistic cohesion of the page, as well as through the globe on navigation page. I have chosen to put a strong emphasis on media as a vehicle into understanding the socio-culture identity of a given country.
