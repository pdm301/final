I decided to focus my final presentation on Japan. For my navigation page, I used webGL to show a 3D image of Yokohama in Japan. I then dedicated my first page to japanese identity, through a collage of cultural symbols which is then superimposed by a map of japan. Once you click the final svg file on the page, japense traditional folk music begins to play. The second page is dedicated to the Japense artist Yayoi Kusama. Due to her obsession with polka dots, I decide to animate circles playing with animation and the html canvas. Finally, I used blender to create a 3D japenese character that I placed into webGL with a video background of modern day Japan .
